This repository hosts the LaTeX source and compiled PDF of "Prompt Engineering as Epistemic Instrumentation: Multi-Lens Frameworks for Bias Detection in AI Research Evaluation" by Brendan Malloy. 

The work introduces a systematic method for using prompt variation to reveal latent value hierarchies in AI systems evaluating scientific research. Three AI models independently assessed 2,548 papers under four distinct lenses (Cold, Implementation, Transformative, Toolmaker), demonstrating orthogonal dimensions of research value, temporal biases, and architectural evaluation patterns.
